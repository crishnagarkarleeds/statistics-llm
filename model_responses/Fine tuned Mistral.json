    "aire_mistral_answer": "Define the probability of drawing a white ball as p = 3/6 = 1/2 and a black ball as 1 - p = 1/2. Use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of drawing exactly two white balls in four trials: P(X = 2) = C(4, 2) * p^2 * (1-p)^2. Calculate the binomial coefficient C(4, 2) = 6. Substitute the values: P(X = 2) = 6 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^2 = 6 * 1/16 = 6/16 = 3/8 = 0.375. Conclusion: The probability of drawing exactly two white balls in four trials is 0.375."

    "question": "A game show has a prize with a 5% chance of being won. If a contestant plays 7 games, what is the probability of winning the prize at least once?",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "To find the probability of winning at least once in 7 games, it's easier to calculate the probability of not winning at all and subtracting that from 1. The probability of not winning a single game is 0.95 (1 - 0.05). For 7 games, the probability of not winning at all is: P(not winning) = (0.95)^7 ≈ 0.737 Now, we find the probability of winning at least once: P(winning at least once) = 1 - P(not winning) ≈ 1 - 0.737 ≈ 0.263 So, the probability of winning the prize at least once in 7 games is approximately 0.263 or 26.3%."

A local government believed their community had a lower smoker rate and commissioned a survey of 400 randomly selected individuals. The survey found that only 42 of the 400 participants smoke cigarettes. If the true proportion of smokers in the community was really 15%, what is the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400 people?",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "Define the true proportion p of smokers in the community. State the null hypothesis H0: p = 0.15 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: p < 0.15. Use the binomial distribution formula to calculate the probability of observing 42 or fewer smokers in a sample of 400. Compute: P(X ≤ 42) = Σ (from x = 0 to 42) [C(400, x) * 0.15^x * (1 - 0.15)^(400 - x)]. Calculate the cumulative probability using the binomial distribution table or software. Determine if the observed result is significant enough to reject the null hypothesis at the given significance level.

Then, we divide by the total number of ways to choose 5 bulbs from 1000. The number of ways to choose 2 defective bulbs is C(40, 2), and the number of ways to choose 3 non-defective bulbs is C(960, 3). The total number of ways to choose 5 bulbs from 1000 is C(1000, 5).

The contestant picks one door. The host then opens one of the remaining doors to show it is empty. The contestant may stick with their choice or switch to one of the other two unopened doors. What is the optimal strategy if the contestant wants to maximise expected wealth and is risk-averse?",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "Initial Probabilities: The probability of choosing the car is 1/4, and the probability of choosing the forfeit is 1/4. The probability of choosing an empty door is 1/2. Host's Action: The host will always open an empty door. This action does not change the probabilities for the remaining two doors. Switching Strategy: If the contestant initially chose an empty door, switching to the other unopened door has a 1/2 chance of winning the car and a 1/2 chance of losing -$1000. The expected value of switching is (1/2 * $1000) + (1/2 * -$1000) = $0. Sticking Strategy: If the contestant initially chose the car, sticking with the choice results in a win of $1000. If the contestant initially chose the forfeit, sticking results in a loss of -$1000. Risk-Averse Considerations: Since the contestant is risk-averse, they should prefer the certain outcome of sticking with their choice over the uncertain outcome of switching.

(b) What does '95% confident' mean? Explain in the context of the application. (c) Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval? (d) If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate would be larger, smaller, or about the same?",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "The confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true average number of days with poor mental health is within this range. Being '95% confident' means that if we were to repeat the survey many times and calculate a confidence interval each time, we would expect 95% of those intervals to contain the true average number of days with poor mental health. A 99% confidence level would require a wider interval because it is more certain, meaning the interval would be larger to capture the true average with 99% confidence. If a new survey were done with only 500 Americans, the standard error of the estimate would be larger because the sample size is smaller. A larger sample size typically provides a more precise estimate. Explanation: Confidence intervals indicate the range within which the true average is likely to fall, and the confidence level reflects the probability that the interval contains the true average. A higher confidence level requires a wider interval, and a larger sample size generally results in a more precise estimate with a smaller standard error."

His father Frank bought him expensive goggles, suspecting they might help him swim faster. In 15 timed swims using the goggles, Jeffrey's sample mean time was 16 seconds. Test whether the goggles helped Jeffrey swim faster, using a significance level of α = 0.05. Assume the swim times are normally distributed.",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "State the null hypothesis H₀: μ = 16.43 and the alternative hypothesis Hₐ: μ < 16.43. Calculate the standard error of the sample mean: σ_x̄ = σ / √n = 0.8 / √15 ≈ 0.207. Compute the z-score for the observed sample mean (16 seconds): z = (x̄ - μ) / σ_x̄ = (16 - 16.43) / 0.207 ≈ -2.08. Find the critical z-value for a one-tailed test at α = 0.05: -1.645. Since -2.08 < -1.645, reject the null hypothesis. Calculate p-value: p ≈ 0.019. Conclusion: The goggles helped Jeffrey swim faster at the 5% significance level. The evidence supports that his mean swimming time decreased significantly."

Use the nonparametric plug-in estimator (difference of the sample means). Report the p-value and a 95% confidence interval for the difference of means. What do you conclude? (b) Use a permutation test to avoid the large-sample approximation. What is your conclusion?",

Difference of means: d̂ = 0.2319 - 0.2097 = 0.0222. Standard error: SE = √(s²_Twain/n_Twain + s²_Snodgrass/n_Snodgrass) = √(0.000297/8 + 0.000086/10) ≈ 0.0071.

(b) Permutation test: Pool all 18 observations and randomly reassign to two groups of sizes 8 and 10. Calculate the difference in means for each permutation. Compare the observed difference (0.0222) to the permutation distribution. The permutation test p-value would be approximately 0.003.

After switching to recycled paper, the company examines a sample of 300 sheets and finds 5 defective sheets. An employee conducts a hypothesis test at the 5% level of significance to assess whether the switch has affected the defect rate. The employee assumes X ~ B(300, p), sets H₀: p = 0.004 and H₁: p ≠ 0.004, and calculates P(X = 5 | p = 0.004) = 0.9985. Based on this, they conclude: 'Since 0.9985 > 0.05, accept H₀. There is no evidence that the defect rate has changed.' Explain the mistakes and determine the correct conclusion.",
    "aire_mistral_answer": "Mistakes identified: Wrong probability calculation: P(X = 5 | p = 0.004) = 0.9985 is incorrect. The correct calculation should be P(X = 5) ≈ 0.0036. Wrong p-value: The p-value should be P(X ≥ 5) for a two-tailed test, not P(X = 5). Incorrect interpretation: The probability 0.9985 represents the cumulative probability P(X ≤ 5), not the exact probability. Wrong terminology: We don't 'accept' H₀, we 'fail to reject' it. Correct analysis: Expected defects under H₀: μ = np = 300 × 0.004 = 1.2. Observed defects: 5 (much higher than expected). Using normal approximation: z = (5 - 1.2) / √(1.2 × 0.996) ≈ 3.48. P-value for two-tailed test: 2 × P(Z > 3.48) ≈ 0.0005. Since 0.0005 < 0.05, reject H₀. Correct conclusion: There is strong evidence that the defect rate has changed after switching to recycled paper.
